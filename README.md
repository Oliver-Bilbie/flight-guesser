# flight-guesser
The flight-guesser repository contains the frontend and backend source code for the flight-guesser application.

When you see an aircraft overhead, you may use the flight-guesser application to guess the destination of the aircraft.
You will score points based on accuracy. Data is sourced from FlightRadar24 using [FlightRadarAPI](https://github.com/JeanExtreme002/FlightRadarAPI).
